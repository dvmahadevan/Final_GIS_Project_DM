## Access to Neighborhood Food Stores in Middlesex County, New Jersey

Command Line GIS by Prof. Will Payne

Project created by Divya Mahadevan


The Final project topic I explored is Access to Neighborhood Grocery Stores and Supermarkets in Middlesex County, New Jersey at the census tract level. According to a report from Food Research & Action Center, 1 in 12 households experienced food insecurity, which means, they did not have reliable access to affordable and nutritious food. Food insecurity is a significant social determinant of health and has disproportionately burdened communities of color. Several factors impact food access, such as, transportation, food supply, federal nutrition programs, community kitchens etc. I focused my research on the availability and access to grocery stores and supermarkets in the neighborhood. 

Here's my interactive map website!

This map shows the location of Food Stores in Middlesex County. When you hover over the marker, you can see the type of Food Store. The Blue markers are part of  Middlesex Counties REPLENISH Program that provides Food Pantries and Senior Meal Programs, while the Green markers are a mix of Supermarkets, Convenience Stores, Delis, and Butchers. When you click on the marker, it will provide you with the geocoded address and service type.

The heat map indicates areas with high concentration of Food Stores in Red and low concentration in Green.

The Buffers are indicative of Access to these food stores. The 1/2 mile walkable buffer shows the areas from which a food store can be accessed within 10 mins of walking.

The 1/2 mile transit stop to food store shows the transit stops that are 10 minutes walking distance from the food stores thereby increasing access to those who can use public transit to buy groceries.

The yellow area is the desert area that does not fall within any 1/2 mile walking distance to a food store nor to a transit stop that is close to a food store.

## Additional determinants of availability of food stores in the neighborhoods. 

Going to Market study highlighted the lack of neighborhood grocery stores providing fresh food options in several New York City communities. In response, the city created the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health Program (FRESH). This study triggered a similar concept in the neighborhoods in Middlesex County to determine desert areas that are categorized as areas not walkable to a food store and areas that are not walkable to a transit stop next to a food store. Additionally, spatial analysis to see how the need for fresh food compares to the density of the neighborhood. 

The NYC study creates a Supermarket Need Index (SNI) which measures the need for supermarkets based on population density, low access to a car at the household level, low household incomes, high rates of diabetes, high rates of obesity, low consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, low share of fresh food retail, and capacity for new stores. I have studied Middlesex County at the census tract level based on population density, age, health, low income, and low access to food stores using US Census data, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, and US Department of Agriculture Food Environment Atlas Data. This allows a comparison of the availability of food stores in dense areas, the aging population, and health-concerned neighborhoods in Middlesex County.
