According to a report from Food Research & Action Center, 1 in 12 households experienced food insecurity, which means, they did not have reliable access to affordable and nutritious food. Food insecurity is a significant social determinant of health and has disproportionately burdened communities of color. Several factors impact food access, such as, transportation, food supply, federal nutrition programs, community kitchens etc. I would like to focus my research on the availability and access to grocery stores and supermarkets in the neighborhoods of Middlesex county by Transit and walkability. 

Here's my interactive map website!

This map shows the location of Food Stores in Middlesex County. When you hover over the marker, you can see the type of Food Store. The Blue markers are part of  Middlesex Counties REPLENISH Program that provides Food Pantries and Senior Meal Programs, while the Green markers are a mix of Supermarkets, Convenience Stores, Delis, and Butchers. When you click on the marker, it will provide you with the geocoded address and service type.

The heat map indicates areas with high concentration of Food Stores in Red and low concentration in Green.

The Buffers are indicative of Access to these food stores. The 1/2 mile walkable buffer shows the areas from which a food store can be accessed within 10 mins of walking.

The 1/2 mile transit stop to food store shows the transit stops that are 10 minutes walking distance from the food stores thereby increasing access to those who can use public transit to buy groceries.

The yellow area is the desert area that does not fall within any 1/2 mile walking distance to a food store nor to a transit stop that is close to a food store.
